3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

I couldn't figure out how to make the %'s work because at first they did not make sense to me. I read through all of the notes.py and I was able to grasp it a little better.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

You can use the match function becuase it looks for the base question within a boader statement and is able to amke your chatbot more versatile. It is useful for the chatbot part of the program and for talking with the user.
